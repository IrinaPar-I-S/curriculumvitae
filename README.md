### Good time of the day! My name is Irina Parshina and here is some information about myself:

I had been studying at the NRU "Higher School of Economics" in Moscow, Russia, on a programme in Computational Linguistics, but unfortunately I had to interrupt my studies due to personal reasons. During that time I have studied abroad with Erasmus+ programme in Pavia, Italy. I am currently studying at the University of Bari "Aldo Moro" in Italy on a programme in Language Mediation.

I am interested in everything related to languages and computational linguistics, honestly. So that, I am looking for opportunities to develop my skills in this field.

Here is more information about myself: [English](/cv_eng.md), [Italian](/cv_it.md).
