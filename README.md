### Good time of the day! My name is Irina Parshina and here is some information about myself:

I have been studying at the NRU HSE (Higher School of Economics) in Moscow, Russia, but unfortunately I had to interrupt my studies due to personal reasons. During that time I have studied abroad with Erasmus+ programme in Pavia, Italy. I am currently studying at the University of Bari "Aldo Moro" in Italy on a programme in language mediation.

I am interested in everything connected to languages and computational linguistics, honestly. So that, I am looking for opportunities to develop my skills in this field.

[Here](/cv_eng.md) is more information about myself.
