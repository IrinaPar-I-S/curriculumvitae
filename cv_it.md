## Descrizione

I am currently looking for the opportunities to develop in the field I am interested in, which is honestly everything connected to languages and computational linguistics.

I have been studying a bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics at the NRU HSE (Higher School of Economics) in Moscow, Russia, but I had to interrupt my studies due to personal reasons. During that time I have studied abroad with Erasmus+ programme. I went to Pavia, Italy, where I took both entirely linguistic courses and those connected to coding (as a course in machine learning or a course of linguistic data analysis).
As for now, I am studying at the University of Bari "Aldo Moro" in Italy on a programme in Language Mediation and taking side courses in coding and data analysis.

During my studying at NRU HSE I wrote a course essay about pronouns in Italian language, which required, among other, automatic analysis of corpora data. Furthermore, as a part of practical experience provided by university I was working with corpora [ValPaL](https://valpal.info/contributions/russ1263#tverbs) and [Russian Constructicon](https://constructicon.github.io/russian/about/).
Moreover, I take part in the student organization that organizes events to popularize science, where students show TED-talk-like performances about their researches, so because of that I have an experience working with people and editing texts.
